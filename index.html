            You should work at startups in your early days ðŸš€
            <br><br> I have heard the line several times from friends and seniors around. But, I have never found the startups to which I should apply. What are the startups which don't have a toxic culture and rather focus on the development of the employees?
            âœ¨
            <br><br> Without the list of startups, I applied to almost any startup I found on the internet during my sophomore year. As a result, I was frustrated with the long working hours, work timing, lack of proper planning, and 50% of the promised
            payouts ðŸ¤¯
            <br><br> I have worked with a lot of organizations starting from early-age startups to tech giants. The reason I believe you should work in a startup is you work closely with the founders, you work in small teams consisting of people who are
            highly enthusiastic, build on top of the latest technology and ultimately you get a chance to work in a production environment. If you are applying for tech giants not pretty sure if you would get an interview call or even a test link. Even
            after you get the interview call it would most probably be a Data Structure Algorithm round so if you are into just dev, cracking those might be a bit difficult ðŸ˜¢
